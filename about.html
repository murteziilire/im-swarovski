            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Swarovski was founded in 1895 by Daniel Swarovski in Wattens, Austria. With the invention of the electric crystal-cutting machine, Swarovski brought precision-cut crystals to the world, which soon became iconic in jewelry, accessories, and beyond. Since then, Swarovski has expanded its reach globally, becoming a leader in the crystal business, bringing its creations to high fashion, home dÃ©cor, and more.</p>
